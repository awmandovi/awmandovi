- 👋🤓 Hi, I’m @awmandovi. I am an ORISE fellow working with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) working at the Pacific Coastal Ecology Branch of the Office of Research and Development. My research involves assessing ocean acidification in estuaries locally (Yaquina and Tillamook Bays, Oregon) and nationally. 
-     1. NEP Project: compiling monitoring data from National Estuary Partners (NEPs) across the USA to assess estuarine health from the perspective of acidification and the effectiveness of state water quality protections. 
-     2. Garibaldi Telemetry System: Programming and testing ocean sensors (Sunburst SAMI-CO2, SeaBird Scientific SeapHOx, YSI EXO Sonde) for deployment at Garibaldi Docks. The sensors require in-lab programming for autonomous deployment, where they will be fixed to the dock and connected to a datalogger via cables which may be accessed remotely.  Through this remote access, monitoring data (Temperature, Salinity, Pressure, pH, and CO2 concentration) will be able to be viewed in near-real time, and commands will be able to be sent to the sensors, eliminating the need for the sensors to be physically removed from deployment prior to either receiving data or sending commands. Code being used for the Telemetry Project
-     3. Climate Monitoring Station: In partnership with Oregon State University, a Climate Monitoring Station is being prepared in Yaquina Bay, and our team is involved in preparing and installing a Burke-o-lator (BOL) for continuous measurement of pCO2 and DIC.  
  
- 🗺️🌎 My broader research interests range from atmospheric to oceanic, from global climate patterns to spatial variation within a single estuary. The underlying theme is a captivation with understanding the nuances governing Earths' natural systems. I have a specific interests in the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on ocean acidification and patterns of precipitation, evaporation, and heat transport. Diving deeper, I am intersted in the dynamics of water quality within estuaries, including but not limited to freshwater riverine input, saltwater oceanic input, anthropogenic runoff, local geology, and biological activity.

- 🎓🌧️ I received my Masters of Science at Oregon State University, Corvallis OR, in Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences where I researched meridional atmospheric vapor transport. My primary research project involved developing a water tagging model of meridional vapor transport. The focus of our model was on the residence time of vapor in the atmosphere, primarily looking at 1. meridional vapor transport distance (from source/evaporation latitude to sink/precipitation latitude) and 2. the isotope Oxygen-18, a useful tracer in paleoclimate due to its propensity for being preferentially precipitated before the lighter, more common Oxygen-16.
- 🎓🌊 I received my Bachelors of Science from the University of Washington, Seattle WA, in Oceanography.


- 🌱 I hail from Cleveland, Ohio, where contrasting seasons and access to Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River first intrigued me in environmental systems and the impact that human society has on them.
